# APP_WebCrawler

The WebCrawler script crawls through BASE_URL passed as a parameter. 

To be handled:
- I previously put the code from 'def crawl' in separate functions (get_subpages, call_count, print_result). It then wouldn't count internal links, external links and call count correctly. So it's temporarily back in 'def crawl'. I previously tested it with https://python.org and got consistent results but altered the code to work with the suggested https://crawler-test.com.
- Task 2

Hi, thanks for taking the time to check it out. If possible, I'd love to get some pointers from you on what can be improved.    

Best regards,
Magda
