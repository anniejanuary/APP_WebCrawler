Hi, thanks for taking the time to check out my web crawler. I'm very much looking forward to hearing any impressions of it you might have.
Here's my contact info: Magda Zaras, magdalena.zaras@gmail.com

Run crawler.py for the WebCrawler script to crawl through BASE_URL argument passed as a parameter. 


There are 3 version of the crawler script that are separate from each other:

1. crawler.py - the most complete version.
To be handled:
- I previously put the code from 'def crawl' in separate functions (get_subpages, call_count, print_result). It then wouldn't count internal links, external links and call count correctly. So it's temporarily back in 'def crawl'. I previously tested it with https://python.org and got consistent results but altered the code to work with the suggested https://crawler-test.com.
- Task 2

2. crawler_B_version.py - my earlier code I altered into crawler.py 

3. crawler_c_version_w_asyncio.py - my try at async
