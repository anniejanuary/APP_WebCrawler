# APP_WebCrawler

The WebCrawler script crawls through BASE_URL passed into it as an argument. 

I previously put the code from 'def crawl' in separate functions (get_subpages, call_count, print_result). It then wouldn't count internal links, external links and call count correctly. So it's temporarily back in 'def crawl'.
