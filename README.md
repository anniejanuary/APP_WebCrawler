# APP_WebCrawler
Hi,

the WebCrawler script crawls through BASE_URL passed as a parameter. 

I previously put the code from 'def crawl' in separate functions (get_subpages, call_count, print_result). It then wouldn't count internal links, external links and call count correctly. So it's temporarily back in 'def crawl'. I previously tested it with https://python.org and got consistent results but altered the code to work with the suggested https://crawler-test.com.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out. If possible, I'd love to get some pointers from you on what can be improved <3 In the meantime I'll keep coding and scouring the interwebs.    

Best regards,
Magda
